# Model Switch

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Choose one explicit route for Main, Subagents, Web Search, image generation, the active conversation, and Plan execution in DeepSeek Harness. Model Switch uses public DSH services and provider-owned adapters; it does not patch DSH Core or manage provider credentials.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/composer-picker.png" alt="Composer Picker with Model, Effort, Context, and Fast controls" width="314"></p>

The picker retains keyboard focus when changing panes or closing search, without overriding search autofocus. Escape from the summary closes the picker and returns focus to its trigger.

## Routes

| Route | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Main model | Default provider, model, and optional effort for newly created sessions. Existing sessions are not migrated. |
| Subagent | Follow the active parent route, or use a fixed provider/model/effort. Workflow overrides remain authoritative. |
| Composer Picker | Changes only the active session and submits the exact catalog model id. Main defaults are preserved. |
| Plan Review | Chooses the execution model before the Plan approval response is sent. |
| Web Search | Keeps official `web_search`; after deployment opt-in, routes through the selected, dynamically declared provider search adapter. |
| Image generation | Provides one stable `generate_image` tool routed through a selected Codex or Grok adapter. |

Invalid, unavailable, or unsupported routes fail explicitly. Model Switch never silently falls back to another provider or model. Composer icons identify the execution runtime: DSH-owned LLM routes use the theme-adaptive DSH whale; providers declaring the Agent role use their own mark. Sidebar quota icons remain provider-specific.

Idle blank sessions may pick an External Agent. Submission, pending-first-turn, and running state reserve the selected execution runtime even before a token or native binding exists: native Antigravity keeps its model/effort choices; DSH keeps LLM-provider choices but disables Agent providers. After the first accepted user message, Composer and Plan Review keep Agent-role rows visible but disabled unless the session is already native-bound. After the active session successfully opens a native Antigravity session, the pickers read its plugin-owned binding and disable other providers while keeping available Antigravity model and effort controls. The DSH global picker lock remains authoritative. Binding reads refresh on mount, input-phase, request-activity or catalog changes, and before selection; failed reads show a localized alert and preserve a known native lock. These reads do not start the native runtime or gate conversation history. Antigravity owns the separate execution-time guard; Model Switch does not create custom Core history events.

The existing 3082 lab replay probe is `node scripts/check-lab-runtime-lock.mjs [native|runtime-absent|plugin-absent]`. It checks the dedicated QA conversation under the already-established condition; it does not disable plugins, select a model, or send a turn. `node scripts/check-lab-native-execution.mjs` verifies the saved guard rejection, restored native continuation, DeepSeek-parent/Antigravity-child completion, and restoration of temporary subagent preferences through public history streams.

## Configure Main and Subagents

Open **Settings → Model Switch**. Main changes affect new sessions only. Subagents may follow Main or use a fixed provider, model, and effort.
Official DSH `0.1.7-alpha.2` makes ConfigForms memory-only in non-loopback browsers. This page shows an unavailable message there; open Settings on the Host loopback URL instead. The composer picker refuses model changes in that mode because the published `session.selectModel` also persists the deployment default, which cannot be safely restored without a writable Main ConfigForm. Remote editing and session-only selection require an upstream authenticated ConfigForm seam and a session-only selection API; this plugin does not bypass the official policy.

Changing the Main or fixed Subagent provider/model replaces the previous model's effort with the target model's default. Models without reasoning support receive no effort.

Follow Main resolves the active parent request first, then the configured Main default. A fixed route is injected before the official Subagent descriptor is created. DSH 0.1.2-alpha.4 carries provider, model, and fixed reasoning effort in that descriptor.

## How custom models appear in the Picker

Model Switch does not turn an arbitrary string in its own settings into a model. A provider plugin must publish the model to the official DSH model catalog first:

```text
Provider configuration
→ provider publishes model rows to the DSH catalog
→ the active session Model Directory exposes provider/model metadata
→ Model Switch groups those catalog rows
→ the Picker submits the original provider id and model id
```

The catalog supplies the provider name, model id/name, reasoning efforts, and default effort. A saved route that is no longer present remains visible as unavailable in Settings; the Picker does not pretend it is routable.

### Variant id grammar

Model Switch groups catalog rows by provider and by the model id after peeling these suffixes:

| Catalog model id | Picker variant |
| --- | --- |
| `acme-v1` | Standard row |
| `acme-v1-fast` | Fast |
| `acme-v1-128k` | Context 128K |
| `acme-v1-1m` | Context 1M |
| `acme-v1-1m-fast` | Context 1M + Fast |

Rules:

- `-fast` creates the Fast axis.
- `-<n>k` and `-<n>m` create Context tiers; suffixes may be combined with `-fast` in either order.
- `reasoning.efforts` creates the Effort choices; `reasoning.defaultEffort` selects the initial value.
- Switching Fast, Context, or Thinking variants keeps the current effort only when the target catalog row supports it; otherwise the target row's default effort (or no effort) is used.
- Reasoning metadata marks a catalog row as Thinking-capable.
- Unrecognized ids remain independent model families; Model Switch never drops them.

To support a combined selection, the provider must publish the combined row. Publishing only `acme-v1-fast` and `acme-v1-1m` cannot represent Fast + 1M; publish `acme-v1-1m-fast` as well. The Picker never synthesizes a model id that the provider did not publish.

## Plan Review

Plan Review owns an execution-model draft separate from Main. **Confirm** first commits that model to the active session, then answers the pending Plan review. A refused commit leaves the review pending and retryable; a Session switch the Host accepted but whose deployment default could not be restored is announced after the answer instead of withholding it. **Reject** and **Discuss in chat** do not execute the Plan.

**Reject** sends the option the asker offered, and any text typed in the card's feedback field as the answer's own `custom` text — plan mode reports that text back to the model as the reason to keep planning, so a rejection can carry what to change. **Discuss in chat** withdraws the takeover so the composer returns and the human speaks in their own words; it uses the Host's `dismiss()` where published and the older generation's `cancel()` otherwise, and names the Host when neither exists. Answering a settled review closes Confirm and Reject, while Discuss and the reload affordance stay reachable so the card always has a way back. Failures keep their wire code (`session/writer-held: …`) visible instead of a bare localized sentence.

## Send-time context protection

When a sent message will use a different model or context-tier id than the last request, Model Switch checks the full pending request against the target window before that request is sent. Choosing a model in the picker does not compact. If the target is over budget, history is compacted once with the previous model through a private compaction engine; DSH's own automatic compaction settings are not changed. Progress appears as plugin notices in the transcript. The budget includes the completion notice and pending model-change notice; an oversized summary blocks the request. Failure keeps the user message in the session and does not send the target request or emit a switch-success notice. Turn the behavior off with **Settings → Model Switch → Check and compact context on send** (on by default). Native External Agent runtimes are not treated as DSH-compactable history.

## What Model Switch does not change

- `web_fetch` and its configured provider
- Vision routing, `read_image`, and ordinary chat attachments
- Provider login, credentials, or provider settings cards
- Official Agent Presets
- Existing provider-specific image tools
- Existing sessions when the Main default changes
- Global compaction policy, titles, or DSH Core

## Installation

Model Switch ships prebuilt code, so an install needs no build authorization. Install it from the npm registry:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add --force dsh-model-switch
```

A packed tarball installs the same build without a registry:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add --force ./dsh-model-switch-0.4.17.tgz
```

Then install only the provider adapters you use. This release was checked against official DeepSeek Harness `0.1.7-rc.2` and verified on `0.2.0-rc.2`:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add --force \
  https://github.com/NOirBRight/dsh-llm-providers-ui/releases/latest/download/dsh-llm-providers-ui-0.2.14.tgz
dsh plugin --profile web add --force \
  https://github.com/NOirBRight/dsh-llm-codex/releases/latest/download/dsh-llm-codex-0.3.23.tgz
dsh plugin --profile web add --force \
  https://github.com/NOirBRight/dsh-llm-grok/releases/latest/download/dsh-llm-grok-0.3.19.tgz
```

### Search routing (0.4.7)

Providers declare independent search adapters and model metadata on the existing Host `ModelSwitchAdapterRegistry`. The browser receives only id/name/model metadata over authenticated Connection RPC, not adapters or credentials. Registration/unload updates subscribers; in-place catalog changes are picked up by the bounded 20-second heartbeat. `ProviderDirectory` remains the client role/usage owner, not a second Host execution registry. Published 0.2.8 `sortCatalogGroups` only ranks hardcoded LLM routes; Model Switch ranks live `catalogRoutes` itself so Agent catalog ids follow saved card order when the Owner publishes them. Native `catalogId` / `unknown` account styling still need a newer Owner than published 0.2.8.

DeepSeek uses the official public `DeepSeekSearchProvider`, the existing `web-search-deepseek` settings and credential service. Codex uses its existing ChatGPT credentials; Grok uses its existing subscription token and provider-owned Responses search. Native conversational networking alone does not create a search option. Missing credentials, invalid settings, unsupported models and unavailable adapters fail explicitly, without fallback.

**Registering an adapter does not select the global Web route.** Installation leaves the deployment's existing Web configuration untouched. To opt in, set the existing Web entry's `searchProvider` to `model-switch` while retaining **every other existing config field**, especially `fetchProvider`. DSH id-targeted patches replace the entire config rather than deep-merging it: copy the complete effective config from `dsh --profile web --dump-config`, then change only searchProvider in the deployment/user patch. Do not copy an assumed `fetchProvider: http` over a custom pin.

After opting in, configure the requested search provider/model in Model Switch Settings. No complete supported route means `WEB_PROVIDER_CONFIGURED_UNAVAILABLE` through the official selector; there is no automatic DeepSeek fallback. Without the global pin, the dropdown does not control `web_search`. An unpinned Web service can become ambiguous when multiple search providers are usable. Before uninstalling Model Switch, restore the deployment's prior search pin; otherwise the official selector correctly reports a missing configured provider. The official `web_search` and `web_fetch` tools are never replaced.

Release-aligned search regression: `DSH_RELEASE_ANCHOR=/path/to/official/install/package.json pnpm exec vitest run --config tests/vitest.release.config.ts`. See [search audit and acceptance](docs/search-provider-audit.md) for exact baselines, dependencies and live status.

If `dsh-composer-picker` is installed, remove it from the profile before enabling Model Switch. Model Switch already owns the Composer Picker and Plan Review seat; two owners produce duplicate or competing UI.

Production profiles must use a released registry version or GitHub tag rather than workspace-local dependencies. Restart the selected DSH profile after installation or route changes.

## Compatibility

DSH Host peers and development dependencies accept `>=0.1.7-alpha.2`, including rc.1 and later releases. The development lockfile resolves to rc.2. Cordis accepts `>=4.0.4 <5.0.0`.

Verified releases: `0.1.7-alpha.2`, `0.1.7-rc.1`, `0.1.7-rc.2`, `0.2.0-rc.2`. The 0.2.0 claim covers the Host's renamed question verbs, its unawaited `session.selectModel` default write, and its returned `ModelDirectory.select` refusal, each verified in the lab and on a live desktop session.

The verified releases in `package.json#dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` are evidence, not an allowlist. Review public API changes and test new Host releases before adding a verification claim.

## Development

Requires Node 22.19+ and pnpm.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check
```

`check` builds Host and Client artifacts, runs unit and Cordis/Settings composition tests, validates the extracted package, and verifies reproducible bundles. Product scope is defined in [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md); implementation constraints live in [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
