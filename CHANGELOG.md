## v0.4.19

Plan Review gains a **Set as goal and run** action: it arms the reviewed Plan as the session's goal and only then answers it, so `dsh-goal-round-driver` carries the Plan after plan mode exits.

- The goal is set before the answer, matching the card's existing commit-then-answer order; a refusal keeps the review pending and reports the Host's own wire code.
- An unfinished goal is replaced through `get` + `clear` + `create` rather than edited, so a new Plan starts with a fresh round cap, and the card says it replaced the previous goal.
- The goal face is resolved per render (`ctx.get('remote.goals', false)`) instead of listed in the static client `inject`, so a deployment that mounts no `@deepseek-ai/dsh-goal` keeps loading this plugin and the action disables itself with an explicit reason while the other three actions keep working. `@deepseek-ai/dsh-goal` is declared as an optional peer.
- The objective is the Plan's trimmed markdown. The plugin stores no goal state, owns no part of the goal domain, and schedules no rounds.
- Records the seam in `docs/seam-gap.md` (the released `remote.goals.create` exists while DSH's own goal surface deliberately omits creation) and the action in PRODUCT.md and both READMEs.

## v0.4.18

Declare official DSH `0.2.0-rc.2` compatible in `package.json#dsh.compatibility.dshReleases`.

Evidence, in the order this repository's compatibility policy requires:

- **Public API review:** the 0.2.x Host renamed the pending-question withdrawal verb (`PendingQuestion.cancel()` → `dismiss()`), fires `session.selectModel`'s deployment-default write without awaiting it, and reports a refused `ModelDirectory.select` as a returned `{ ok: false }` value instead of throwing. Each difference broke v0.4.16, and each is fixed in v0.4.17.
- **Tests and build:** `pnpm run check` green — `tsc` + `tsdown`, the full vitest suite, and the pack gate against a real tarball.
- **Lab plane:** profile composition `exit 0` with no skipped bundle, Host boot on port 3082 with the plugin's capability RPC answering, and the npm-installed build booting on port 3085 with its client bundle served.
- **Live desktop verification on 0.2.0-rc.2:** all three Plan Review actions exercised against a real session — Discuss withdraws the takeover and returns the composer; Reject delivers typed feedback verbatim as the answer's `custom` text; Confirm commits a different execution model, approves the plan, and restores the Main default to its pre-switch value.

## v0.4.17

First release published to the npm registry, so `dsh plugin --profile <name> add dsh-model-switch` installs prebuilt code without a git build authorization. Publishing builds `lib/` through `prepublishOnly`, and `pnpm run check` now runs its pack gate on Windows as well.

- Plan Review **Discuss in chat** now withdraws the takeover through the verb the running Host publishes (`PendingQuestion.dismiss()` on 0.2.x, `cancel()` on 0.1.x) instead of calling `cancel()` unconditionally, which threw on a Host that renamed it; a Host exposing neither is named explicitly.
- Plan Review **Reject** sends text from the card's feedback field as the answer's `custom` text, so a rejection reaches the model with what to change instead of a bare option label.
- Compensate the deployment default through the namespace revision actually observed: wait for the Host's unawaited `session.selectModel` default write, fence on the observed revision, retry once against a concurrent edit, and never fail the answer. The previous `captured + 1` fence assumed an awaiting Host and could either refuse the restore (leaving the Plan unanswerable) or silently leave the Main default switched.
- Treat a refused official `ModelDirectory.select` result as an uncommitted model change instead of reporting success.
- Keep Confirm and Reject closed after a settled review while Discuss and a reload affordance stay reachable, and surface the wire code of a failed action.
- Fix a line-ending fragile mobile width-budget assertion.
- Make the pack gate portable: resolve npm's own CLI when a shell-less spawn cannot launch the Windows `.cmd` shim, compare archive members across line endings, and link the extracted package with a junction on Windows.

## v0.4.16

- Bundle shared Provider UI helpers from the published v0.2.14 release.
- Apply the official menu backdrop material and preserve picker focus through model selection, pane changes, and search dismissal.
- Keep search autofocus and return focus to the trigger when Escape closes the summary.
- Verify official DSH 0.1.7-rc.2 with open-ended Host dependency ranges.

## v0.4.15

Accept DSH releases from 0.1.7-alpha.2 onward through open-ended peer and development ranges. Rebuild and verify against official 0.1.7-rc.1 without changing model routing behavior.

## v0.4.14

Target official DSH `0.1.7-alpha.2`, pin Provider UI `0.2.12`, and move Main, Subagent, search, image, and compaction controls to published ConfigForms. On non-loopback browsers the official forms are memory-only: Settings shows an explicit unavailable state and the picker refuses selections that would otherwise persist a deployment-wide default without a safe restoration path.

## v0.4.13

Replacement Subagent runtime exposes public `resolveMaxDepth` so Host 0.1.6-alpha.2 Standard remount keeps Model Switch routing. Compile target stays `0.1.5-rc.1`.

## v0.4.12

Optional Default Subagent route (Official inherit when off) and Switch compaction as a Send protection B-row.

## v0.4.11

Rank live catalogRoutes. Compact-on-switch uses previous-provider usage when present.

# Changelog

## [0.4.10] - 2026-09-13

- Include completion notices in the send-time budget; verify concurrent sessions, retained-input retry, live progress, and durable notice replay through the real agent loop.
- On send, when the assembled target model or context-tier id differs from the last request, check the pending request against the target window and compact once with the previous model if needed. Picker-only changes do no work. Default on; Settings → Model Switch can turn it off without disabling DSH automatic compaction.
- DSH Host packages are no longer version-locked. `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peers are `*` and optional; unknown Hosts warn once and still mount. Cordis stays `>=4.0.2 <5.0.0`. Compile-target `devDependencies` remain `0.1.5-rc.1`.
- Keep Fast / Context / Thinking / Effort switches on the current Agent after a turn; disable unpublished sibling rows instead of ignoring clicks.
- Composer picker Cursor mark comes from `dsh-llm-providers-ui` 0.2.6.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-09-09

- Reserve the selected execution runtime as soon as a prompt is submitted, before the first token or native binding.
- Native Antigravity keeps its models and effort; DSH keeps LLM-provider choices and disables Agent providers until cancel or a durable native binding.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-09-07

- Development dependency now points at the final `dsh-llm-providers-ui` 0.1.10 release URL with pinned integrity; Alpha.4 fixtures updated coherently (roots + provider identity + fresh self-root tarball).

## [0.4.7] - 2026-09-06

- Unify provider-owned independent Web search metadata and execution for DeepSeek, Codex and Grok through the existing adapter registry and authenticated capability RPC.
- Reuse official DeepSeek search settings/credentials and preserve the deployment’s complete Web config, including fetchProvider. Global search routing remains an explicit opt-in with no silent fallback.
- Recover capability polling after transient failures and Host revision resets; skip unchanged heartbeats without hiding unload warnings or enabling stale saves.
- Preserve Antigravity session routing and released v0.4.6 runtime compatibility; correct picker test fixtures without weakening approval safety assertions.
- Coordinate with Codex 0.3.14, Grok 0.3.11 and Provider Directory 0.1.9; install and validate immutable packages in lab before production promotion.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- DSH compatibility declarations cover the verified Alpha.4 and rc.1 runtimes.
- Unknown runtimes warn once and use the normal best-effort mount path; only reproduced failures may be blocklisted.


## 0.4.2

- Settings → LLM Providers: drag cards to reorder; chat picker follows `llm-providers.order` via dsh-llm-providers-ui.


## 0.4.3

- Keep a Host-accepted composer selection visible while its durable Session projection catches up, then return authority to newer projected selections.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-08-29

- Support DSH 0.1.2-alpha.1 through the public Cordis, Settings, Remote, Session, and Model Directory services after the monolithic client runtime removal.
- Carry fixed Subagent reasoning effort on alpha.1.
- Let the composer model trigger use the full available seat width on mobile instead of clipping long model labels.
- Keep Composer and Plan model switches session-local with a revision-fenced Main-default restore where the Host couples session selection to deployment defaults.
- Publish bilingual product documentation and screenshots, including the provider-catalog rules for custom Picker families.

## 0.3.11 - 2026-08-27

- Lock the real composer UI path for independent Context 1M and Fast On selection: when the provider catalog publishes a combined `*-1m-fast` row, the picker preserves both dimensions and submits that exact model id.
- Document through regression evidence that providers must publish the combined row; separate `*-1m` and `*-fast` rows cannot represent both dimensions simultaneously.

## 0.3.10 - 2026-08-27

- Keep mobile picker triggers, headings, model names, catalog descriptions, and values readable by rendering and wrapping instead of truncating.
- Resolve optional mobile interaction operations only through Cordis's typed public non-strict service lookup.
- Consolidate each picker snapshot and its operations into one render view backed by the official directory status/routability contract, retaining selected routes absent from the advisory catalog.
- Isolate popup activation, positioning, and dismissal in a deep internal module.
- Keep composer and Plan Review picker crashes mounted as localized, retryable diagnostics.
- Preserve Plan Review's one-row mobile footer while shrinking controls and wrapping action labels inside their buttons at narrow widths.

## 0.3.9 - 2026-08-27

- Preserve the 320px preferred picker width whenever the mobile viewport allows it, shifting away from the trigger instead of squeezing to 240px.
- Hide horizontal list overflow while retaining vertical scrolling, removing the mobile horizontal scrollbar.

## 0.3.8 - 2026-08-27

- Keep a mobile pointer's open/close intent idempotent through the 750ms tap-fallback window so a detail-zero programmatic click cannot reopen a picker that the user just closed.

## 0.3.7 - 2026-08-27

- Make click the sole owner of picker toggle state so one mobile touch cannot open on pointerdown and immediately close on its synthetic click.

## 0.3.6 - 2026-08-27

- Restore non-strict lookup for the optional mobile interaction service; Cordis may reject direct undeclared-property access, which previously crashed the custom seat on render.

## 0.3.5 - 2026-08-27

- Declare the merged picker's Sessions and model-directory services in the client plugin's top-level injection contract so production completes the custom seat registration.

## 0.3.4 - 2026-08-27

- Contain composer-seat render/effect errors inside the merged picker so a crash cannot silently abdicate to the official picker; show a retryable diagnostic instead.
- Treat the Sessions face as optional while the public model-directory service gate is active.

## 0.3.3 - 2026-08-27

- Restore merged picker ownership of the composer model seat by matching the official service gate and using an unambiguous winning priority.
- Treat optional mobile interaction-surface failures as a graceful degradation instead of crashing and abdicating the custom seat to the official picker.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-08-27

- Match Model Switch route cards to the shared LLM Providers chrome: radius, fill, border, spacing, icon treatment, title weight, summary size, chevron, and expanded body.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-08-27

- Keep the Model Switch settings nav glyph after the official Settings shell redraws its SVG.
- Restore a visible platform-gray fill for collapsed route cards; every route remains collapsed on mount.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-27

- Absorb the composer model picker and Plan Review execution picker into this package.
- Plan Review uses the official warn-strip card, a short capsule trigger, and a two-level Model/Effort/Context/Fast/Thinking menu.
- One `dsh plugin add dsh-model-switch` now covers routing Settings and composer/Plan selection. Remove a standalone `dsh-composer-picker` install to avoid a second model seat.
- Picker trigger shows the family name plus distinct effort / Fast / context bits; duplicate context windows collapse to one menu row.
- Known limitations: Settings nav icon still patches official nav DOM (no public icon field, same pattern as usage-monitor).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-26

- Keep official `web_search` ownership and add a thin `model-switch` Web Search provider with Codex model routing.
- Add stable `generate_image` routing through optional Codex and Grok adapters, with provider-specific schemas regenerated after Image route changes.
- Add Search and Image settings cards while keeping Vision/read_image excluded.
- Preserve existing provider-specific image tools and `web_fetch` as rollback paths.


## 0.1.1 - 2026-08-26

- Ship compiled Host/Client `lib/` in the git tag so `github:…#v0.1.1` installs can boot.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-26

- Add Main default and follow-main/fixed Subagent model routing for DSH 0.1.1-rc.2.
- Resolve follow-main from the active parent request header before stale session options.
- Preserve inherited provider/model when rc.2 cannot carry reasoning effort.
- Leave Search, Vision, image reading, ordinary chat attachments, and image generation on their existing official/provider paths.
- Add localized Model Switch settings and clean plugin lifecycle integration.
- Keep ordinary chat attachments on the official DSH path.
